# PROGRESS — EA QMS Change Control Backend (Go)

**Scope of this file:** what is built, what is next, decisions made in working sessions
that are not recorded in any guardrail document, and open flags. Nothing else — the six
guardrail docs carry the substance and are always attached.

- **Repo:** `github.com/lain-the-coder/ea-qms-backend`
- **Last checkpoint:** 2 — `002_change_controls.sql`
- **Next task:** checkpoint 3 — `003_file_attachments.sql` (not started)

---

## Completed

### ✅ Checkpoint 1 — Scaffold + users migration

**Repo**

- `go mod init github.com/lain-the-coder/ea-qms-backend`
- `sql/schema/` and `sql/queries/` created
- `.gitignore` contains `.env`; `.env` filled; `.env.example` committed with empty values
- Keys in both: `DB_URL`, `PLATFORM`, `JWT_SECRET`
- Local database `ea_qms` created via psql
- Placeholder `main.go` — `ServeMux`, `WelcomeHome` handler, port `:1304`

**`sql/schema/001_users.sql`** — applied, up → `\d` → down → `\dt` → up clean.

Verified against DB Design §3.1 / §5.1 / §6.1 by reading `\d users`:

| Check                                                          | Result |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| 8 columns, §3.1 order and names                                | ✅     |
| `TIMESTAMPTZ` on `created_on`, `updated_on`                    | ✅     |
| 4 defaults: `gen_random_uuid()`, `true`, `now()`, `now()`      | ✅     |
| `ck_users_role` — four values, ASCII                           | ✅     |
| `uq_users_email` **functional** unique index on `lower(email)` | ✅     |
| `idx_users_role_active` composite `(role, is_active)`          | ✅     |

### ✅ Checkpoint 2 — change_controls migration

**`sql/schema/002_change_controls.sql`** — applied, full up → down → up cycle verified.
The largest file in the schema.

Verified against DB Design §3.2 / §4.1 / §5.1 / §6.1 / §6.2 / §8.1:

| Check                                                                                                                    | Result |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| **50 columns** — confirmed by `information_schema.columns` count, not by eye                                             | ✅     |
| Field-group order per §3.2; fields 24 and 34 correctly absent (they are `file_attachments` rows)                         | ✅     |
| Types incl. `DATE` ×3, `TIME` ×2, `TIMESTAMPTZ` ×5                                                                       | ✅     |
| 10 NOT NULL, 40 NULL (§1.6 — required for Save Draft)                                                                    | ✅     |
| 7 defaults; `cc_id` has none                                                                                             | ✅     |
| `cc_number_seq` + `cc_id GENERATED ALWAYS AS (...) STORED` with the `CASE` LPAD guard (§8.1)                             | ✅     |
| 13 CHECKs, `ck_cc_*` names, values verbatim                                                                              | ✅     |
| Three value traps held: ASCII hyphens in `'Yes - Full testing'`; `'Approve'`/`'Reject'` not past tense; no `'Emergency'` | ✅     |
| 5 FKs → `users(id)`, all `ON DELETE RESTRICT`, long-form names (§4.1 rows 1–5)                                           | ✅     |
| `uq_change_controls_cc_id` as a **UNIQUE CONSTRAINT**, not a `CREATE INDEX` (§5.2 #3) — `\d` confirms the wording        | ✅     |
| 6 `CREATE INDEX` (§5.1 #4–#9), `DESC` on `idx_cc_created_on`; 8 index entries total incl. PK                             | ✅     |
| Down drops **table then sequence**; `\ds` after down confirms `cc_number_seq` gone, and the re-`up` succeeds             | ✅     |

**The lesson in this migration:** a separately-created sequence is not owned by the table.
`DROP TABLE` alone leaves it orphaned and the next `up` fails on `CREATE SEQUENCE ...
already exists`. Order matters too — dropping the sequence first fails, because the
column default depends on it.

## Next

### ⬜ Checkpoint 3 — `003_file_attachments.sql`

Sources: DB Design **§3.3** (9 columns) · **§4.1 rows 6–7** · **§5.1 #10** · **§6.1**.

- 9 columns; `file_data` is `BYTEA` (files stored in-DB), `file_size` `BIGINT`,
  `uploaded_on TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()`
- `ck_file_attachments_field_name` — closed set `{'supporting_documents',
'implementation_evidence'}`
- **First CASCADE in the schema:** `change_control_id → change_controls(id)` is
  **`ON DELETE CASCADE`** (§4.3 — a file has no meaning without its CC).
  `uploaded_by_id → users(id)` stays `RESTRICT`. Do not apply RESTRICT to both by reflex
- `uq_file_attachments_cc_field UNIQUE (change_control_id, field_name)` — declared as a
  **table constraint**, not a `CREATE INDEX` (§5.2 #3, same as `uq_change_controls_cc_id`).
  It is also the `ON CONFLICT` target for the re-upload upsert
- No sequence here, so the Down block returns to a plain `DROP TABLE`

### ⬜ Remaining migrations

`004_audit_logs` (10 columns — **no `action_description`**; `entity_id` is a soft
reference with **no FK**, §2.3) · `005_esignatures` · `006_refresh_tokens` · seed (4 users,
one per role, hashed with the app's own argon2id — never pasted hashes, gated on
`PLATFORM=dev`, §7)

### ⬜ Then

sqlc setup (`emit_pointers_for_null_types: true`) → build in API Endpoint Plan order,
starting `POST /api/login`.

## Session decisions not in any guardrail doc

Settled in working sessions and binding. They exist nowhere else.

| 1   | **Module path `github.com/lain-the-coder/ea-qms-backend`** — not `-cc-backend`                              | Future QMS modules (Deviation, CAPA) live under the same module rather than forcing a second repo                                                                                                                                 |

Also keeps names clear of Postgres's 63-byte identifier truncation |
| 3   | **Two naming exceptions kept verbatim:** `uq_change_controls_cc_id` and `ck_cc_post_impl_issues`            | Spelled that way in §3.2/§5.1 and §6.1 respectively — do not "regularize" them                                                                                                                                                    |
| 4   | **FK constraints use the long form** — `fk_change_controls_change_owner_id`                                 | §4 lists all eleven FKs but never names the constraints, so §1.3 stands unopposed for this object type. Decision #2 does not extend to FKs. Longest name is 48 chars, clear of the 63-byte limit                                  |
| 5   | **PostgreSQL 14.23 accepted** (doc §1.2 specifies 15+)                                                      | Every needed feature traced and predates 14: `gen_random_uuid()` core (13), `GENERATED ALWAYS AS ...

| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **`change_controls` column count contradiction.** §3.2 and the §3 Summary state **48 columns**, but §3.2's own parenthetical reads "id + cc_number + 48 of the 50 BRD fields" = **50**. The doc's "48" counts BRD fields and mislabels them as columns                       | **Resolved: built 50, confirmed in the database.** Doc correction pending |
| 2   | **`change_controls` DEFAULT count.** §6.4 says 8; §6.2 enumerates 7. The likely 8th is `cc_id`, which §6.2 explicitly states has _no_ DEFAULT (it's a generation expression)                                                                                                 | **Resolved: 7, confirmed in the database.** Doc correction pending        |
| 3   | **`updated_at` vs `updated_on` on `refresh_tokens`.** Blueprint §7's code sample uses `updated_at`; DB Design §3.6 and CONTEXT_HANDOFF both say `updated_on`. Per precedence the DB doc wins — the Blueprint snippet is stale. Affects migration 006 and the refresh handler | Logged, resolution clear                                                  |
| 4   | **En-dash in HTML prototype `<option value="...">`.** A frontend built from the prototypes verbatim fails `ck_cc_requires_testing` on every submit — that constraint is now live in the database. Frontend must normalize at the API boundary, or the prototypes get fixed   | Open risk, pre-existing (DB §6.5)                                         |

| 6   | **Production version parity.** Dev is on PostgreSQL 14.23; if production runs 15/16 there's a major-version gap.

## Environment & workflow

WSL Ubuntu 22.04 · VS Code Remote-WSL · Go 1.25.x · PostgreSQL 14.23 · DBeaver for
browsing — but **read `\d` in psql first**; the GUI normalizes and can hide things like
whether an index is on `email` or `lower(email)`, or whether a unique object is a
constraint or a bare index.

```bash
# migrations — run from sql/schema
goose postgres "postgres://postgres:PASS@localhost:5432/ea_qms?sslmode=disable" up
goose postgres "postgres://postgres:PASS@localhost:5432/ea_qms?sslmode=disable" down

# dry-run a migration before handing it to goose — psql reports the exact line
# and a caret; goose only reports that something failed
psql "postgres://postgres:PASS@localhost:5432/ea_qms?sslmode=disable" -f 003_file_attachments.sql

# psql
psql "postgres://postgres:PASS@localhost:5432/ea_qms?sslmode=disable"
#   \l  databases   \dt  tables   \ds  sequences   \d <table>  detail   \q  quit
#   \pset pager off        before \d on wide tables, or the output gets mangled
```

**Every migration gets up → `\d` → down → `\dt` (+ `\ds` if it creates a sequence) → up
before it counts as done.** If down doesn't cleanly reverse up, the migration has a bug —
find it now, locally (Blueprint §13).

### Things learned at the psql prompt

- Postgres **rewrites `IN (...)` as `= ANY (ARRAY[...])`** in the catalog, so `\d` never
  reads back character-for-character as written. Normalization, not drift.
- A **UNIQUE constraint** displays as `UNIQUE CONSTRAINT, btree (col)`; a bare
  `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX` displays as `UNIQUE, btree (col)`. This is how to tell which form
  actually got built.
- `TIMESTAMPTZ` displays as `timestamp with time zone`; `TIME` as
  `time without time zone`. Canonical spellings, nothing wrong.
- **Verify column counts with SQL, not by counting a terminal paste:**
  `SELECT count(*) FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'x';`
- **Postgres column-definition rule** (this cost several rounds on 002): everything
  between `CREATE TABLE x (` and `)` is one comma-separated list. Column-level constraints
  live inside a column's own definition and take no column list; table-level constraints
  (FKs, multi-column UNIQUE) are their own list items and require one. A semicolon
  anywhere inside the parens terminates the statement early.
