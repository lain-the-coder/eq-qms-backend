# PROGRESS — EA QMS Change Control Backend (Go)

**Scope of this file:** what is built, what is next, decisions made in working sessions
that are not recorded in any guardrail document, and open flags. Nothing else — the six
guardrail docs carry the substance and are always attached.

- **Repo:** `github.com/lain-the-coder/ea-qms-backend`
- **Last checkpoint:** 9 — `POST /api/login` · **1 of 22 endpoints done**
- **Next task:** checkpoint 10 — `middlewareAuth` + `GET /api/me`
- **Schema version:** 6 · all six tables built and verified
- **Review loop:** paste code in chat for review _before_ committing — review precedes
  commit, never follows it. (The repo is public and can be cloned if ever useful to look
  at already-committed code, but that is not the default workflow.)

## Completed

### ✅ Checkpoint 1 — Scaffold + users migration

**Repo**

- `go mod init github.com/lain-the-coder/ea-qms-backend`
- `sql/schema/` and `sql/queries/` created
- `.gitignore` contains `.env`; `.env` filled; `.env.example` committed with empty values
- Keys in both: `DB_URL`, `PLATFORM`, `JWT_SECRET`
- Local database `ea_qms` created via psql
- Placeholder `main.go` — `ServeMux`, `WelcomeHome` handler, port `:1304`

**`sql/schema/001_users.sql`** — applied, up → `\d` → down → `\dt` → up clean.

| Check (DB §3.1 / §5.1 / §6.1)                                  | Result |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| 8 columns, §3.1 order and names                                | ✅     |
| `TIMESTAMPTZ` on `created_on`, `updated_on`                    | ✅     |
| 4 defaults: `gen_random_uuid()`, `true`, `now()`, `now()`      | ✅     |
| `ck_users_role` — four values, ASCII                           | ✅     |
| `uq_users_email` **functional** unique index on `lower(email)` | ✅     |
| `idx_users_role_active` composite `(role, is_active)`          | ✅     |

### ✅ Checkpoint 2 — change_controls migration

**`sql/schema/002_change_controls.sql`** — applied, full up → down → up cycle verified.
The largest file in the schema.

| Check (DB §3.2 / §4.1 / §5.1 / §6.1 / §6.2 / §8.1)                                                                       | Result |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| **50 columns** — confirmed by `information_schema.columns` count, not by eye                                             | ✅     |
| Field-group order per §3.2; BRD fields 24 and 34 correctly absent                                                        | ✅     |
| Types incl. `DATE` ×3, `TIME` ×2, `TIMESTAMPTZ` ×5                                                                       | ✅     |
| 10 NOT NULL, 40 NULL (§1.6 — required for Save Draft)                                                                    | ✅     |
| 7 defaults; `cc_id` has none                                                                                             | ✅     |
| `cc_number_seq` + `cc_id GENERATED ALWAYS AS (...) STORED` with the `CASE` LPAD guard (§8.1)                             | ✅     |
| 13 CHECKs, `ck_cc_*` names, values verbatim                                                                              | ✅     |
| Three value traps held: ASCII hyphens in `'Yes - Full testing'`; `'Approve'`/`'Reject'` not past tense; no `'Emergency'` | ✅     |
| 5 FKs → `users(id)`, all `ON DELETE RESTRICT` (§4.1 rows 1–5)                                                            | ✅     |
| `uq_change_controls_cc_id` as a **UNIQUE CONSTRAINT**, not a `CREATE INDEX` (§5.2 #3)                                    | ✅     |
| 6 `CREATE INDEX` (§5.1 #4–#9), `DESC` on `idx_cc_created_on`                                                             | ✅     |
| Down drops **table then sequence**; `\ds` confirms; re-`up` succeeds                                                     | ✅     |

**Lesson:** a separately-created sequence is not owned by the table. `DROP TABLE` alone
orphans it and the next `up` fails. Order matters — dropping the sequence first fails,
because the column default depends on it.

### ✅ Checkpoint 3 — file_attachments migration

**`sql/schema/003_file_attachments.sql`** — applied, cycle clean.

| Check (DB §3.3 / §4.1 / §5.1 #10 / §5.3 / §6.1 / §6.2)                 | Result |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| 9 columns, all NOT NULL; `BYTEA` / `BIGINT` correct                    | ✅     |
| 2 defaults; `ck_file_attachments_field_name`                           | ✅     |
| `change_control_id` → **ON DELETE CASCADE** (§4.1 #6)                  | ✅     |
| `uploaded_by_id` → **ON DELETE RESTRICT** (§4.1 #7)                    | ✅     |
| `uq_file_attachments_cc_field` as a **UNIQUE CONSTRAINT** (§5.2 #3)    | ✅     |
| **Zero `CREATE INDEX` statements** (§5.3)                              | ✅     |
| No `file_size` CHECK — 10 MB and MIME rules stay in the handler (§3.3) | ✅     |

**Lesson:** no separate index on `change_control_id` — leftmost prefix of the composite
already serves "all files for this CC".

### ✅ Checkpoint 4 — audit_logs migration

**`sql/schema/004_audit_logs.sql`** — applied, cycle clean.

| Check (DB §3.4 / §2.3 / §4.1 #8 / §5.1 #11–13 / §6.1 / §6.2)         | Result |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| 10 columns; 7 NOT NULL, 3 nullable                                   | ✅     |
| **No `action_description` column**                                   | ✅     |
| `ck_audit_logs_entity_type` (2), `ck_audit_logs_action_type` (**9**) | ✅     |
| **`entity_id` is a bare `UUID NOT NULL` with no FK** (§2.3)          | ✅     |
| `fk_audit_logs_performed_by_id` RESTRICT — the only FK               | ✅     |
| 3 indexes; no UNIQUE; no immutability triggers (§8.3)                | ✅     |

**Lesson:** `entity_id` looks exactly like a foreign key and must not be one — it points
at either table depending on `entity_type`, and audit rows must outlive what they describe.

### ✅ Checkpoint 5 — esignatures migration

**`sql/schema/005_esignatures.sql`** — applied, cycle clean.

| Check (DB §3.5 / §4.1 #9–10 / §4.3 / §5.1 #14 / §6.1 / §6.2)                   | Result |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| 7 columns, all NOT NULL; no `updated_on`, no soft-delete (§3.5)                | ✅     |
| `ck_esignatures_transition` — T2–T8, **T1 never signs**                        | ✅     |
| `ck_esignatures_meaning` — 7 values, **ASCII hyphens verified in the catalog** | ✅     |
| Both FKs **RESTRICT**, incl. `change_control_id` (§4.3)                        | ✅     |
| `idx_esignatures_cc`; **no UNIQUE** (rejection loops repeat a gate)            | ✅     |

**Lesson:** mirror image of checkpoint 3 — `change_control_id` CASCADEs in
`file_attachments` and RESTRICTs here. Same column, same target, opposite rule.

### ✅ Checkpoint 6 — refresh_tokens migration · schema complete

**`sql/schema/006_refresh_tokens.sql`** — applied, cycle clean.

| Check (DB §3.6 / §4.1 #11 / §4.3 / §5.1 #15 / §6.2 / §6.4)           | Result |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| 6 columns; **PK is `token TEXT`, no surrogate `id UUID`**            | ✅     |
| `revoked_at` the only nullable column                                | ✅     |
| **`updated_on`, not `updated_at`** — flag #3 resolved for the DB doc | ✅     |
| 2 defaults; **zero CHECK constraints** — the only such table         | ✅     |
| `fk_refresh_tokens_user_id` **ON DELETE CASCADE** (§4.3)             | ✅     |
| `idx_refresh_tokens_user`                                            | ✅     |

**Lesson:** three timestamps, three jobs. `updated_on` = 30-min **sliding** inactivity
window; `expires_at` = absolute cap; `revoked_at` = logout. And CASCADE here vs RESTRICT
on `audit_logs`/`esignatures` — a session is disposable, a signature is not.

### ✅ Checkpoint 7 — sqlc setup

**`sqlc.yaml`** (v2) — engine `postgresql`, queries `sql/queries`, schema `sql/schema`,
out `internal/database`, package `database`. sqlc understands goose annotations and
ignores the `-- +goose Down` statements.

**`sql/queries/users.sql`** — two queries:

- `CreateUser :one` — inserts only `full_name`, `email`, `hashed_password`, `role`;
  the other four columns come from schema defaults. `RETURNING *`
- `GetUserByEmail :one` — `WHERE LOWER(email) = LOWER(sqlc.arg(email))`. The `LOWER()`
  wrapper is required twice over: case-insensitive login, **and** the planner only uses
  `uq_users_email` when the query contains the same expression the index was built on.
  `sqlc.arg(email)` forces the generated parameter name (sqlc otherwise inferred `lower`)

**Generated:** `internal/database/{db.go, models.go, users.sql.go}` — never hand-edited.
`WithTx(tx *sql.Tx)` is present, which Blueprint §9's `qtx := cfg.db.WithTx(tx)` needs.

**Deps:** `lib/pq`, `google/uuid`. sqlc and goose are CLI tools, not imports — correctly
absent from `go.mod`.

**Verified:** `models.go` no longer imports `database/sql` at all — proof that zero
`sql.NullXxx` types remain. `ChangeControl` has all 50 fields, 40 as pointers and the 10
NOT NULL ones plain. `User`, `Esignature` and `FileAttachment` are entirely plain, so
`nullable: true` scoped correctly.

**Lesson:** see decision #10 — the Blueprint §2 / §4 contradiction and how it was resolved.

### ✅ Checkpoint 8 (Part A) — `internal/auth` argon2id + app wiring

Auth foundation plus the application plumbing the API sits on. `go build ./...` and
`go test ./...` both pass.

**`internal/auth/password.go`** — `HashPassword(password, *argon2id.Params)` and
`CheckPasswordHash(password, hash)`, wrapping `alexedwards/argon2id`. Blueprint §2 names
the _algorithm_ (argon2id), not a package, so the library choice was open — using a
reviewed implementation rather than hand-rolling PHC encoding, `crypto/rand` salting and
constant-time comparison. `CheckPasswordHash` returns `(false, nil)` for a wrong password
and an error only for a malformed hash, so the 401-vs-500 distinction survives to the
caller.

**`internal/auth/password_test.go`** — external test package (`auth_test`), so it exercises
only the exported API as a real caller would. Asserts: correct password matches; wrong
password → `false` with `nil` error; the same password hashed twice → two different strings
(per-call random salt). Uses `argon2id.DefaultParams` so the test needs no `.env`.

**`apiConfig`** — all four Blueprint §8 fields: `db *database.Queries`, `rawDB *sql.DB`,
`secret string`, `params *argon2id.Params`. `rawDB` is required for `BeginTx`, which
`*database.Queries` cannot do on its own.

**`main.go`** — `sql.Open` **followed by `Ping`**: `Open` is lazy and will not surface bad
credentials or a stopped server, so `Ping` is what actually fails loudly at startup.
Distinct fatal messages for the two failures (driver/URL vs network/credentials/server).
`log.Fatal(server.ListenAndServe())`.

**`helpers.go`** — `respondWithJSON` / `respondWithError` and the `errorResponse` type.
**`config.go`** — `loadArgon2idParams` / `parseUintConfig`: params from env with explicit
code defaults. A **missing** variable falls back to the default; a **malformed** one is
**fatal** and names the offending variable and value — no silent weakening of a security
parameter. `.env.example` carries the five `ARGON2ID_*` keys.

**Structure note (Blueprint §5):** flat `package main` at the repo root — `main.go`,
`helpers.go`, `config.go`, and later `middleware.go` / `handlers_*.go`. Only `internal/auth`
and `internal/database` are separate packages. Handlers get their own files, all still
`package main`, created when written — not stubbed ahead. Run with **`go run .`** (compiles
the whole package), not `go run main.go` (one file — can't see the helpers).

**Lesson:** `sql.Open` does not connect. Without `Ping`, a bad DSN or a down server yields
a clean startup and a failure on the first query, far from the cause.

---

### ✅ Checkpoint 8 (Part B) — `cmd/seed`

**`cmd/seed/main.go`** — standalone dev-only command (DB §7). Its own `package main` under
`cmd/`, run with `go run ./cmd/seed`. Sequence: `godotenv.Load` → **`PLATFORM == "dev"` gate
before any DB connection** (§7.5) → `sql.Open` + `Ping` → `database.New` → hash
`DevPassw0rd!` once with `auth.HashPassword` (argon2id) → loop the four §7.2 users through
the generated `CreateUser`.

Four users seeded and verified in the table: correct roles (`'CC Owner'` with its space
satisfied `ck_users_role`), `is_active = t` and `created_on` from schema defaults never
touched by the insert, `created_on` carrying a `+04` offset — `TIMESTAMPTZ` storing zone,
not naive local time (§1.4, now visible in real data). UUIDs generated by the database.

**Second-run behaviour: fail loudly.** Errors are fatal per user; a re-run stops on the
first `uq_users_email` duplicate with Postgres code **`23505`** surfaced through `pq` —
proving the case-insensitive unique index is live and the seed won't double-insert. That
`23505` inspection is the same one Blueprint §11 uses to turn a unique violation into a
clean 409.

**Lesson:** this was the first full `Go → sqlc → lib/pq → Postgres` path — every layer
(config load, driver, argon2id hashing, sqlc query, schema defaults) proving itself at
once, with nothing hand-wired.

### ✅ Checkpoint 8b — structured logging (slog + context)

Consciously fills the Blueprint §15 gap (was `log.Printf`, no correlation IDs). **All
plumbing is now complete.**

**`internal/logging/logging.go`** —

- `NewLogger(logDir)` builds a `*slog.Logger` whose handler is a custom **`multiHandler`**
  fanning out to two destinations: `slog.NewTextHandler` → console (human-readable) and
  `slog.NewJSONHandler` → `logs/app.log` (append). slog ships no multi-destination handler,
  so `multiHandler` implements the four `slog.Handler` methods and forwards each to both
  children. The log file is never closed — it lives for the process lifetime (deliberate).
- **`contextKey` / `loggerKey`** — unexported key type + const, so the context key can't
  collide and only this package can touch it.
- **`ContextWithLogger(ctx, logger)`** (setter) and **`LoggerFrom(ctx)`** (getter) — the
  guarded door in and out of context. `LoggerFrom` uses the `comma-ok` assertion and falls
  back to `slog.Default()` if absent — never fails, never panics.

**`middlewareLogging`** (in `middleware.go`, outermost middleware) — mints a
`uuid.NewString()` request ID, derives a per-request logger with
`cfg.logger.With("request_id", id)`, stashes it in context via `ContextWithLogger`, and
logs `request started` / `request finished` with method, path and duration.

**Handlers** pull the request logger with `log := logging.LoggerFrom(r.Context())` as the
first body line — every line they emit is auto-stamped with that request's `request_id`.
This is the one reusable line dropped into all 22 handlers.

**`main.go`** — logger built **first**, before config, so startup failures are logged;
`slog.SetDefault`; the startup `log.Fatalf` calls converted to `logger.Error` + `os.Exit`.
`WelcomeHome` wired through `middlewareLogging` (variation 1) as the end-to-end proof.

**Verified:** three lines (`request started` → `welcome home hit` → `request finished`)
share one `request_id` across console (text) and `logs/app.log` (JSON); concurrent requests
get distinct IDs; the `Warn` path (blank message) fires from inside the handler carrying its
own request's ID. `logs/` gitignored.

**Lesson — the delivery split (decision #12).** The request logger travels via **context**
because its absence is harmless (`LoggerFrom` degrades to default). The authenticated user
(coming next) will travel as an **explicit handler argument** because its absence must be a
_compile error_, not a runtime surprise. Same principle — match the delivery mechanism to
what happens when the thing is missing. Also learned: `http.Handler` is the interface
(accept it, call `next.ServeHTTP`); `http.HandlerFunc(...)` is the converter that turns a
bare `func(w,r)` into a handler. Middleware output registers with `mux.Handle`; bare
handlers with `mux.HandleFunc`.

---

### ✅ Checkpoint 9 — `POST /api/login` (endpoint 1 of 22)

First real endpoint. Registration is **variation 1** (public — logging only, bare handler
wrapped in `http.HandlerFunc`). `WelcomeHome` retired.

**`internal/auth/jwt.go`**

- `MakeJWT(userID, secret, expiresIn)` — HS256, `jwt.RegisteredClaims` only, issuer
  `ea-qms` via a shared `const issuer`, one `time.Now().UTC()` anchor for both `iat`/`exp`.
- **No role in the token, deliberately.** `middlewareAuth` loads the user from the DB on
  every request anyway (it must, for `is_active`), so the role is always fresh. Baking it
  into a 30-minute token would mean a BR-8.4.11 role change silently doesn't take effect
  for up to half an hour.
- `ValidateJWT` — `ParseWithClaims` with a keyfunc that **validates the signing method is
  HMAC** (rejects `alg` confusion / `none` attacks) and `jwt.WithIssuer(issuer)`. Expiry is
  checked by the library during parse. Returns `uuid.Nil` + wrapped error on failure.

**`internal/auth/tokens.go`** — `MakeRefreshToken()`: 32 bytes from `crypto/rand`, hex.
**Returns an error rather than `log.Fatal`** — a library function must never kill the
process; that decision belongs to the caller.

**`internal/auth/jwt_test.go`** — round trip, wrong secret rejected, expired rejected,
malformed rejected. All pass.

**`sql/queries/refresh_tokens.sql`** — `CreateRefreshToken :one` (token, user_id,
expires_at; the rest from schema defaults).

**`handlers_auth.go`** — decode → blank checks → `GetUserByEmail` → `CheckPasswordHash` →
`is_active` → `MakeJWT` → `MakeRefreshToken` → `CreateRefreshToken` → respond.

| Check                                                                                | Verified |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| Six-field response (id, full_name, email, role, token, refresh_token)                | ✅       |
| `ADMIN@EAQMS.LOCAL` logs in — `LOWER(email)` query + functional index                | ✅       |
| Wrong password and unknown user return **byte-identical** 401s                       | ✅       |
| JWT payload: `exp − iat = 1800` (30 min exactly)                                     | ✅       |
| `refresh_tokens` rows with `expires_at` 24 h out, `revoked_at` NULL                  | ✅       |
| Logs: shared `request_id`, WARN + real `reason`, generic client message, no password | ✅       |
| All four seeded accounts log in; `owner@` returns role `CC Owner` (space intact)     | ✅       |
| Timing equalised: unknown email 209 ms vs wrong password 229 ms (was 5 ms vs 137 ms) | ✅       |

**Key ordering decision — password checked _before_ `is_active`.** The reverse would tell an
attacker "Account is deactivated" for a _wrong_ password, revealing the account exists.
Checking the password first means bad credentials always get the same generic 401, and
"deactivated" is only disclosed to someone who already proved they hold valid credentials.

**Timing side-channel closed.** The not-found path originally skipped argon2id entirely, so
valid emails were enumerable by response time alone (5 ms vs 137 ms — a 27× gap, measured).
Fix: `apiConfig.dummyHash` is generated **once at startup** with the real argon2id params,
and the not-found branch runs `CheckPasswordHash` against it (`_, _ =` — the result is
discarded, only the elapsed cost matters). Both branches now cost ~210–230 ms.

**Other decisions:** token lifetime is server-controlled (`accessTokenTTL = 30m` const) —
the Chirpy pattern of a client-supplied `expires_in_seconds` is an attacker-controlled
lifetime and was dropped. `refreshTokenTTL = 24h` is the **absolute** cap (see decision #13).
**No audit row** — `ck_audit_logs_action_type` has no login action; login isn't audited in
Phase 1.

**Logging convention established** (reused by every handler from here): short **stable
`msg`** (`"login failed"`) + a **`reason`** field for the variant + identifying fields
(`email`, `user_id`) + `error` only on system faults. `Warn` = user error, `Error` = system
fault. This makes `msg="login failed"` find every failure while `reason=` narrows it.

## Next

### ⬜ Checkpoint 10 — `middlewareAuth` + `GET /api/me` (endpoints 4)

The auth spine. `internal/auth`: `GetBearerToken(r.Header)`. New query: `GetUserByID`.
Then `middlewareAuth` per Blueprint §7 — the `authedHandler` three-parameter type, four
gates (bearer → validate JWT → load user → `is_active`), calling `next(w, r, user)`.
**This is where registration variation 2 appears** and where the explicit-user-argument
pattern (decision #12) becomes real: a three-param handler cannot be registered without
passing through `middlewareAuth`, so forgetting auth is a compile error.

`GET /api/me` is then trivial — return the user already handed to the handler.

**Then, in API Endpoint Plan order:** refresh/revoke (sliding window) → user management
(incl. the `FOR UPDATE` transaction) → CC create/get/list/save-draft → **T2 submit, the
first full transition, written inline** → T3, T4/5 (extract only then) → files → T6 →
T7/8 → dashboard → signatures.

Rejected: switching to pgx (abandons §2's reasoning and changes the `BeginTx`/`WithTx` shape) and accepting `sql.NullXxx` (pays every cost §4 argued against — garbage JSON, a ×40 mapping loop, hand-rolled three-state draft logic). Five overrides give both. **The `db_type` spellings are not uniform and were found empirically: `text`, `timestamptz`, `date`, `uuid` bare; `time` requires `pg_catalog.time`.** Also: omit the `package` key when the import path already ends in the package name, or sqlc emits duplicate imports and the build fails                      |

The library already does PHC-string encoding, `crypto/rand` salting, parameter round-tripping and constant-time comparison — a reviewed implementation rather than hand-rolled crypto plumbing. Params are set **explicitly** (not `DefaultParams` in app code) so a library-default change can't silently alter hashing strength, and so the values are auditable                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 12  | **Data delivered to handlers by two different mechanisms, chosen by failure mode: request logger via `context`, authenticated user via explicit argument**                                  | Fills the Blueprint §15 logging gap. The rule: _match the delivery mechanism to what happens when the thing is missing._ A missing logger is harmless → `context` value with a `slog.Default()` fallback (`LoggerFrom`). A missing authenticated user is a security hole → explicit third argument on an `authedHandler` type, so forgetting auth is a **compile error**, not a runtime surprise — the compiler becomes an auth control, which matters for a regulated system. Not inconsistency: same principle, opposite stakes. (Considered and rejected: context for both, for surface consistency — it would trade a compile-time guarantee for a per-route discipline across 22 routes.) Logging is minimal per §0/§15: request ID + start/finish + errors; runtime level-filtering deferred (slog provides the levels regardless) |
| 13  | **Refresh token absolute expiry = 24 hours** (`refreshTokenTTL`); access token = 30 minutes (`accessTokenTTL`)                                                                              | The 30-min _sliding_ window on `updated_on` is specified by the guardrails; the **absolute** cap is not, so it was chosen here. Two clocks cover two threats: the sliding window logs out a walked-away session, but it cannot stop an _active_ attacker — a stolen token refreshed every 29 minutes would live forever, because the window measures inactivity. `expires_at` is stamped once at login and never moves, so a leaked token dies within 24 h regardless. 24 h covers any shift pattern while bounding exposure to a single day. Rejected: Chirpy's 60 days (far too long for a regulated system)                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Not a defect — the cost of collision-free IDs under concurrency — but QA will ask                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Behaviour note; may warrant a line in user documentation                                                           |
| 9   | **`TIME` columns scanning into `*time.Time` is unverified at runtime.** `database/sql`'s `convertAssign` handles pointer-to-pointer natively, so `*string` and `*time.Time` are safe for `text`/`timestamptz`/`date` with lib/pq. But bare `TIME` (`implementation_window_start` / `_end`) may arrive from lib/pq as `[]byte` rather than `time.Time`, which would fail conversion. **First exposed when reading a CC with window times (≈ endpoint 12).** If it fails, the fix is a `column:` override to `string` plus parsing in the handler                                                  | Unverified — test at first read                                                                                    |
| 10  | **Log rotation not implemented.** `logs/app.log` is append-only and grows unbounded. Fine for dev; production needs size/date-based rotation (e.g. lumberjack or logrotate) to avoid filling disk.

| 11  | **Login timing side-channel (measured, not theoretical).** Observed response times: unknown email **5 ms**, wrong password **137 ms**, success **267 ms**. The not-found path skips the argon2id comparison entirely, so valid emails are enumerable by timing alone — no message difference needed. Mitigation is ~5 lines: run `CheckPasswordHash` against a throwaway dummy hash on the not-found path so both branches cost the same. Fixed in checkpoint 9: a dummy hash generated once at startup is verified on the not-found path, equalising the cost. Measured after: 209 ms vs 229 ms | **Closed**                                                                                                         |

## Environment & workflow

WSL Ubuntu 22.04 · VS Code Remote-WSL · Go 1.25.3 · PostgreSQL 14.23 · sqlc v1.31.1 ·
DBeaver for browsing (decision #9).

```bash
# migrations — run from sql/schema
goose postgres "postgres://postgres:PASS@localhost:5432/ea_qms?sslmode=disable" up
goose postgres "postgres://postgres:PASS@localhost:5432/ea_qms?sslmode=disable" down
goose postgres "postgres://postgres:PASS@localhost:5432/ea_qms?sslmode=disable" status

# dry-run a migration before handing it to goose — psql gives a line number and a caret
psql "postgres://postgres:PASS@localhost:5432/ea_qms?sslmode=disable" -f <file>.sql

# sqlc — run from the repo root
rm -rf internal/database && sqlc generate && go build ./... && go mod tidy

# go — run the whole main package, not a single file
go run .                    # NOT `go run main.go` (that can't see helpers.go / config.go)
go build ./...              # compile-check every package
go test ./...               # run all tests (build alone does not execute them)
go run ./cmd/seed           # run the seed command (checkpoint 8 Part B)

# psql
psql "postgres://postgres:PASS@localhost:5432/ea_qms?sslmode=disable"
#   \l  databases   \dt  tables   \ds  sequences   \d  everything   \d <table>  detail
#   \pset pager off        before \d on wide tables, or the output gets mangled
```

**Every migration gets up → `\d` → down → `\dt` (+ `\ds` if it creates a sequence) → up
before it counts as done.** The final `up` is easy to forget — `goose status` confirms
where the database actually stands.

### Things learned at the prompt

- Postgres **rewrites `IN (...)` as `= ANY (ARRAY[...])`** in the catalog, so `\d` never
  reads back character-for-character as written. Normalization, not drift.
- A **UNIQUE constraint** displays as `UNIQUE CONSTRAINT, btree (col)`; a bare
  `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX` displays as `UNIQUE, btree (col)`.
- `TIMESTAMPTZ` → `timestamp with time zone`; `TIME` → `time without time zone`.
- **Verify counts with SQL, not by counting a terminal paste:**
  `SELECT count(*) FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'x';`
- **Postgres column-definition rule** (cost several rounds on 002 and 003): everything
  between `CREATE TABLE x (` and `)` is one comma-separated list. Column-level constraints
  sit inside a column's definition and take no column list; table-level constraints (FKs,
  multi-column UNIQUE) are their own list items and require one. Comma between items, none
  after the last, semicolon only after the closing paren.
- **Sequences are non-transactional** — `nextval()` does not roll back (flag #8).
- Once a statement errors inside a transaction, psql aborts the block until `ROLLBACK`.
- **Invisible characters can't be eyeballed** — scan a file for any codepoint above 127
  before running it. Every value in this schema is ASCII.
- **Copy-paste between migrations is the most common error source.** 006's index was
  briefly created `ON esignatures`; it failed only because the column name didn't exist
  there. Always re-read the table name in a copied `CREATE INDEX`.
- **`go build ./...`** — `...` is Go's recursive package wildcard, so this compiles every
  package in the module rather than just the current directory. Build first, `go mod tidy`
  after it's clean; tidy parses imports and is unreliable on broken files.
- **`go run .` runs the package; `go run main.go` runs one file.** Once `package main` is
  split across files (`helpers.go`, `config.go`), the single-file form fails with
  "undefined" errors for everything in the other files. Use `go run .`.
- **`sql.Open` does not connect** — it's lazy. Always `Ping` right after, so a bad DSN or a
  down server fails at startup instead of on the first query in a handler.
- **Review loop:** the repo is public, so committed code can be cloned and reviewed
  directly — push, say "pushed", no need to paste files. Only committed code is visible;
  uncommitted working-tree changes are not. `.env` is correctly gitignored and never seen.
